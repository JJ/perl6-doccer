# perl6-doccer

Docker container for
testing [perl6 documentation](https://github.com/perl6/doc)

It might have some use elsewhere, specially complex Perl6 modules, but
it's been created and built specifically for this.

You can use it with

	sudo docker run -v $PWD:/test --rm -it jjmerelo/perl6-doccer
